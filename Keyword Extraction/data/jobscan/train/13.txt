What does data and technology have to do with a top ten bank? The answer is âEverythingâ. At Capital One, data lives at the center of everything we do. When we launched in 1988 we quickly disrupted the credit card industry by individually personalizing every credit card offer using statistical modeling and relational databases.
,

Fast-forward and this little innovation and our passion for data has skyrocketed us to become a Fortune 200 company and leader in the world of data-driven decision-making. We take our mission of Changing Banking for Good very seriously. As a Data Scientist at Capital One, youâll be part of a team thatâs leading the next wave of disruption at a whole new scale, using the latest in distributed computing technologies and operating across billions and billions of customer transactions to unlock the big opportunities that help everyday people save money and remove the âfrictionâ from their financial lives. The Capital One Data Science campus internship program will provide you with the chance to see first-hand how your skills and education translate into solving business problems in the financial services industry.

As a data science intern you will get the opportunity to work closely with our data science community to solve various financial services problems using cutting edge techniques. Interns are a full-fledged member of the teamâengaged from day one through structured training, a diverse set of experiences, a network of peers across the company, and leadership opportunities. The program is designed to provide exposure to real, complex operational projects. On any given day you might: 1.
,

Evaluate open source and internally-developed modeling and analytics tools. These are both âbigâ and âlittleâ data oriented and could be developed in R, Python, C/C++, Scala, strongO, or a language that is âTBDâ and waiting to be unpacked. Finally, you will have the opportunity to work with AWS, internal Hadoop, Spark, Pig, Hive, Impala, and other processing stack elements. 2.
,

Share evaluation results and insights with data science teams via internal blogs, Stack Exchange, and GitHub. 3. Write tools, wrappers, and scripts to help teammates perform their jobs more efficiently and effectively. Example â build a standard pipeline that does grid-search model parameter estimation and then flows straight into a series of diagnostics about how well the model that was just produced performs.
,

4. Write software to clean and investigate large, messy data sets of numerical and textual data 5. Integrate with external data sources and APIs to discover interesting trends (NOAA Weather Data + Credit Card Transactions = Fascinating!) 6. Design rich data visualizations to communicate complex ideas to customers and company leadership 7.
,

Develop an internal portal to streamline processes and accelerate discovery time for new information related to tools, APIs, etc. The Ideal Candidate will beâ¦ 1. Smart. Youâre a top performing student.
,

2. Curious. You ask why, you explore, you're not afraid to introduce and defend a crazy idea. Create machine learning models or data sets to âchallengeâ existing modelsâ âbreakingâ developed models to ensure reliability and resiliency.
,

Review and replicate models and create real and thought experiments to determine if and how the model holds up under different scenarios. 3. Data Savvy You know how to move data around, from a database or an API, through a transformation or two, a model and into human-readable form (ROC curve, chart, map, visualization, etc.). You know Python, Java, R, C/C++, Spark, Storm, Julia, SQL, Matlab, Mahout, or think everything can be done in a Perl one-liner.
,

4. Do-er. You have a bias toward action, you try things, and sometimes you fail. Expect to tell us what youâve shipped and whatâs flopped.
,

5. Fearless. Big, undefined problems and petabytes donât frighten you. Youâre not intimidated by new tools or technologies.
,
