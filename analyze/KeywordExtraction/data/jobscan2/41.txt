The Department of Consumer Affairs (DCA) empowers consumers and businesses to ensure a fair and vibrant marketplace. DCA licenses and regulates over 80,000 businesses in 35 different industries, and enforces the Consumer Protection Law and other related business laws in New York City. The agency educates the public and businesses through outreach and partnerships with weights and measures regulations, and the New York City Consumer Protection Law.

Effective April 1, 2014, under New York City’s Earned Sick Time Act, most employers in New York City will be required to give their employees sick leave. DCA is charged with enforcement of this law.

The DCA Office of Financial Empowerment (DCA/OFE) is the first local government initiative in the country with the specific mission to educate, empower, and protect individuals and families with low incomes. DCA/OFE creates innovative programs, products, and services for New Yorkers so they can build assets and make the most of their financial resources. At the center of the fight to reduce income inequality and expand economic opportunity, DCA/OFE works to support low-income New Yorkers and communities in building wealth and improving financial capabilities. DCA/OFE’s goal is to increase access to high-quality, low-cost financial education and counseling; connect individuals to safe and affordable mainstream banking products and services; improve access to income-boosting tax credits, savings, and other asset building opportunities; and enforce and improve consumer financial protections to safeguard financial stability.
